Spring cleaning for builds

Every time I build an open source project from scratch, I end up installing a bunch of dependencies.
Surprisingly often, this works out fine. But often it's tricky to get the build working the same 
way on multiple systems.

Containerize it right?  

I want an accurate copy of the production environment inside a container, but I still want to be able to edit files and
use my web framework's auto-reload feature.

In this case I want something like the 

[web.sh script in the Pinfactory project](https://github.com/pinfactory/pinfactory/blob/master/web.sh).

All the dependencies get installed in the Dockerfile,
but then the source code (including all the template
files, CSS, and graphics) is in a volume shared with
the container.  This way I can do a 
<code>[flask run](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/master/server/)</code>

inside the container, and when I edit a file in the volume, it Just Works and auto-reloads.  Pinfactory is easy to
work on in containers. You can run one script to do all the unit tests in a container, one script to start up a web
server with real data, and there's even a tricked-out script that creates a container with multiple users.

And here's a simple [Dockerfile for a Jekyll project](https://github.com/dmarti/smmd/blob/gh-pages/Dockerfile) that I can use to preview a big Jekyll site locally, without installing any Ruby packages.  This way of running Jekyll worked well enough that 
I now have a personal RPM that conflicts out all the Ruby packages, so that I know I am doing everything reproducibly in a container. <span class="aside">Memo to self: when they add a time travel feature to Git, send that Dockerfile back in time to when I trying to maintain a company web
site on Jekyll and it never came out quite the same on everyone's machine.</span>

Containers for developing and testing web sites have solved so many problems for me that I'm now
taking the container idea that works so
well for working on a web site and applying it to
conventional software builds.


## Building a simple tool to sign files

I run my own mail server and other services. (My blog is on a VPS with a static site generator.) 
That means tracking and deploying a bunch of files that end up in a bunch of different places.

I want to be able to sign them and check signatures.  If you have a bunch of stuff deployed it's nice to be able to verify files.
But setting up Gnu Privacy Guard on all those systems is kind of a pain.  What I really need is a lighter-weight signature tool, that I can use to sign and check my config files.

Looking around, I found [signify, the OpenBSD tool to signs and verify signatures on files, in a portable version.](https://github.com/aperezdc/signify).


Looks like just what I need.  Sign stuff, be able to check the integrity of files on a remote system, not a lot to configure, easy to script.

Also, a good test for a new way to make a software build easy to manage and repeatable.


Fortunately, Signify has a very nice build that facilitates what I want to do.  
I can build a statically linked signify, and the man page, that will work on all my Linux systems of whatever distribution.  No
dependency on the system version of the libraries

Signify is also a good example of a program to build and install, because it includes an interesting dependency and a step where the Makefile
checks the OpenPGP signature of the dependency.  So it's a good opportunity for Earthly practice.



## About Earthly

Earthly is a tool for 

It uses the Docker daemon to manage containers.

I have run it with both `docker-ce` and with the Fedora 32 Docker setup.

Target: this is like a target in a Makefile, except that the result is an entire container image, including all side effects.
If anything in your build leaves stray files behind in /tmp or the user's home directory, they will be peristed.

Recipe: the steps needed to build a target

More info: [Earthfile reference](https://docs.earthly.dev/earthfile) 



## Planning a Signify build.

The build process looks roughly like this.

First, I'll get the base system including any native packages needed for the build.  I'll use
`debian-stable` as a base, because I know it and it has reasonable versions of what I need.

Then get the specific dependency specified by the signify Makefile -- the right version of
libbsd.  Save that.


Finally, copy in my version of the code, run make, and save the artifacts I want.


Seems pretty simple.





## The build already does what I want

Good news. The signify build is already set up to download libbsd and build it into a statically
linked singify binary.  All I have to do is...

  RUN make BUNDLED_LIBBSD=1 static

That's great.  Let's make it work with the build plan.


## First try

First whack at getting the dependencies

make libbsd-download

I'll just run that in the container to get the bundled libbsd before doing the build.

	RUN gpg --import /root/keys/libbsd.asc
	RUN make BUNDLED_LIBBSD=1 libbsd-download

Denied!  It turns out that if I try to do the whole
`libbsd-download` target, then GPG will try to leave
a socket behind under `.gnupg` in the build user's
home directory.


```
+build | ERROR: (RUN [make BUNDLED_LIBBSD=1 static]) executor failed running [/bin/sh -c  /bin/sh -c 'make BUNDLED_LIBBSD=1 static']: buildkit-runc did not terminate successfully: context canceled: context canceled
Error: solve side effects: build error group: solve: failed to solve: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = failed to compute cache key: failed to create hash for /root/.gnupg/S.gpg-agent: archive/tar: sockets not supported
```

If you were Googling for the above error message, the
tl;dr answer is: either (1) don't try to do any build steps
that run GPG until the final stage of your Earthfile,
or (2) remove the sockets by adding 

	RUN rm -f /root/.gnupg/S*

before the `SAVE IMAGE`.

So this technically works.  Copy the signify sources over,
then import the key, then `make` the libbsd-download step.

Then remove the GPG sockets because they can't be saved in the container image, and save the image.

	RUN gpg --import /root/keys/libbsd.asc
	RUN make BUNDLED_LIBBSD=1 libbsd-download
	RUN rm -f /root/.gnupg/S*
	SAVE IMAGE



## Fixing the libbsd problem.

The problem with that is that if I change something in the

signify source code, the Earthly build has to go download libsd again.

This is slow, and bad style, and

Ideally you have all your dependencies 

so if there's a network outage, or a trade war, or
some developer rage-quits and takes their downloads
down, the build will still go brrrrr.







If I change something in one of the C source files, I don't want to go out on the network and get libbsd again.  So
I'll make a separate
